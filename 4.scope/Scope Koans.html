<h1>Scope Koans</h1>

<p>
Each of the functions in <em>sniper-scope.js</em> asks you to make a prediction: will <em>AgentinScope</em> be equal to true or false? The tests for this problem will pass if your prediction is correct. Note that the tests for each of these functions run in the same order in which they're defined in sniper-scope.js.<br>
It's best to get each test to pass before moving onto the next function. If you get a prediction wrong, try to understand the observed behavior before moving on.
